# Low-rank-MIMO-channel-estimation-from-one-bit-measurements
This directory contains the code required to reproduce the results in our ICASSP 2020 submission titled "Low-rank mmWave MIMO channel estimation in one-bit receivers"

Steps to execute our program:-

1) Unzip "NYU_raw_data.zip" that has mmWave channel data from the NYU simulator
2) Run the ipython notebook "block_test.ipynb" for low rank MIMO channel estimation [1].
